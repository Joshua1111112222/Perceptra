        <h1>How to Use Perceptra</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to Perceptra created by Joshua The! This page will guide you on how to use the app properly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Step 1: Enter your full name on the login page to login.<br>
            Step 2: Check your schedule of when you are scouting and scroll down to continue to scouting.<br>
            Step 3: Enter data in the main screen after you login and submit it when finished, after you submit, make sure to upload to the server with the upload button. Make sure you upload every 5 matches. This will require internet to upload but everything else will work offline<br>
            Step 4: If you are an admin, use the admin password to access logs about teams. Admins, please do not clear the logs until after the season is over for the most accurate AI powered insights and data visualization.
            Step 5: To play Deluxe Cookie Clicker, click the button on the main screen. This will open a new tab with the game. You can play it while waiting for matches to start or during breaks. Enter your username which is your full name followed by Mobile if you are on your phone.<br> You can save the game and then upload your score to the leaderboard to see your scores compared to everyone else's. The game will upload your score to the leaderboard and save it when you go back. <br>
            Step 6: AI powered insights are for seeing a summary of a specific team and for finding alliance selections and comparing two different teams. You can use it but remember the better you scout the better it works!<br>
            Step 7: The Team Performance Tracker is for tracking the performance of a team across a season. This helps seeing how teams improve over a season and remember the better you scout the better it works for you and for everyone else!<br>
            Step 8: You can use the Predict Match Outcome to see how a match will go based on the data you have entered. This is for scouting and for seeing how teams will do in the future. Remember the better you scout the better it works! If there is no team with the team number you entered it won't work as well.<br>
